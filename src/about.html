            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>
              We automatically collect publicly available product and pricing information from
              Australian gel blaster retailers and present it in an easy-to-compare format. This
              helps you make informed purchasing decisions without having to manually check multiple
              websites.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>
              All product information displayed on this site is sourced from publicly accessible
              APIs and web pages provided by the retailers themselves. We do not have any special
              access or partnerships with these stores.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Accuracy:</strong> While we strive to keep information up-to-date, prices
                and availability can change at any time. Always verify details on the retailer's
                website before making a purchase.

            <h2>Privacy & Analytics</h2>
            <p>
              We use Google Analytics to understand how people use this site and which stores are
              most popular.

            <p>
              If you'd prefer not to be tracked, any ad blocker (like uBlock Origin) will block
              Google Analytics automatically. The site works perfectly fine without it.
